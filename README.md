# Project OrDi#

## General

This application will be able to connect customers and service provider through the digital interface. Customer will be able to audit progress of some task/project made by service provider and stay in touch with him/her during some obstacles or notify if must be performed.

To better understand the purpose of an app, let's create a scenario of you as a customer wanting to order some car service.

1. You drop your car at the service. Service provider tells you that he/she will inform you once it's done, but approximately it will take 1,5 hours.

2. Project has been registrated by service provider in the app for a customer to audit the progress.

3. Customer get's a notification that his/her task is DONE, so the car could be picked up.

4. Customer will be able to complete the payment through an app

This app is good to use when amount of services you purchase becomes too hard to handle just my simple message service like WhatsApp.

Also if the project consists of multiple steps like for example building a house, then project could be splitted into multiple steps to be accomplished.
